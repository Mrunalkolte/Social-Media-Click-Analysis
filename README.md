Click Analysis of Social Media Ads-

This project focuses on analyzing the click data from social media advertisements using various Python libraries. 
The analysis aims to provide insights into the performance of ads, helping to optimize future campaigns. 
The primary tools used for this analysis include Plotly for visualization and NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

1)Key Features  -   
a)Data Handling: Utilize Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
b)Numerical Computations: Use NumPy for various numerical operations.
c)Interactive Visualizations: Create interactive plots using Plotly's graph_objects and express modules.
d)HTML Reports: Export and embed visualizations into HTML reports with Plotly's io module.

2)Libraries Used  -  
a)pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
b)numpy: For numerical computations.
c)plotly.graph_objects: For creating detailed and customized visualizations.
d)plotly.express: For quick and easy plotting.
e)plotly.io: For exporting visualizations to various formats.

3)Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy plotly

4)Run the analysis:
Open and execute the provided Jupyter notebooks to perform the click analysis and generate visualizations.

5)Usage
a)Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare your data using Pandas.
b)Analysis: Use NumPy for numerical analysis and calculations.
c)Visualization: Create and customize interactive plots using Plotly's graph_objects and express.
